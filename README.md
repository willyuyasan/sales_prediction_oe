# sales_prediction_oe
 A time series model implementation to predict the amount of temporal sales for distinct stores

 This solution have 2 parts:

 - Data science part, located on the "data_science" folder, where is procesed, explorated, analyzed and modelled the input data for the excercise. Here is built a data analytic model in order to generate prediction for new data

 - App and deliverable part, located on the "app" folder, where some of computational science is developed to build an application to implement the predict solution for a final user. The goal of this part is making the model usable for any user just by accesing to a html frontpage. This app helps to free all the operational charge on the data scientist when preictions are required, because anyone can run and produce predictions
