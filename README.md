# sales_prediction_oe
 A time series model implementation to predict the amount of temporal sales for distinct stores

 This solution have 2 parts:

 - Data science part, located on the "data_science" folder, where is procesed, explorated, analyzed and modelled the input data for the excercise. Here is built a data analytic model in order to generate prediction for new data

 - App and deliverable part, located on the "app" folder, where some of computational science is develop to build an application to implement the predict solution to a final user. The goal of this part is making the model usable for any user from html frontpage, and with this drop the operational charge of the data scientist with producing prediction
